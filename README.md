# Data-Quality-Assessment
I have performed a data quality assessment on the dataset provided by SPROCKET CENTRAL PTY LTD on my GitHub repository. The assessment involved checking for various issues such as missing values, inconsistencies in data format, and outliers.

Overall, the dataset was found to have a good level of completeness and accuracy. However, some issues were identified such as inconsistent date formatting and some values that were recorded as outliers.

I have provided recommendations on how to address these issues, such as standardizing date formats and removing outliers. The data quality assessment report and the cleaned dataset are available on my GitHub repository for further reference.
